# WIP Python scripts for processing the voltage data from our Arduino. 
# Calculates the Strain, the Theoretical Force applied to create this strain, and the Percentage Error relative to the actual force that produced this strain.
# Provides live graph of our Voltage v. Calculated Quantities; writes data to a CSV file which we can import into Excel/Sheets afterwards.
# testCSV shows successful writing of data to a CSV file; testPlot shows shows successful animation of 2 sets of values that are updated each frame.
